Early Boston was a hilly peninsula originally inhabited by the Massachusetts tribe of Native Americans who have lived in the area since 2400 BC. The tribe called the area Shawmut and the nearby river, which is now known as the Charles River, the Quinnebequi.

The small peninsula was only 789 acres wide and consisted of three hills that settlers later named Trimount: Mount Vernon, Beacon Hill and Pemberton Hill, as well as two other hills they named Copp’s Hill and Fort Hill.

The entire blooming period can last up to 14 days, which includes the days leading up to peak bloom. The National Park Service (NPS) annually predicts the official peak bloom and shares details on its website, which also indicates that “it is nearly impossible to give an accurate forecast much more than 10 days before the peak bloom.” The best viewing of the cherry blossom trees typically lasts four to seven days after peak bloom begins, but the blossoms can last for up to two weeks under ideal conditions.

The first American lighthouse was built in Boston Harbor in 1716. Boston is home to the oldest public park in the U.S. The very first chocolate factory in the United States was build in the Lower Mills section in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. In January 15, 1919, a storage tank holding more than 2 million gallons of molasses burst, sending a giant wave of the hot syrupy substance through the North End of Boston. It killed 21 people and several horses and injured more than 100 others, making it the worst molasses-related accident in history.

You can drive 90 feet below the earth’s surface in Boston. Boston’s Ted Williams Tunnel is the deepest in North America, running nearly 90 feet underneath the earth’s surface.

Bostonians couldn’t celebrate Christmas between 1659-1681. It was against the law because the Pilgrims believed it to be a corrupted holiday.
